# Advent of Code - solutions

Solutions that I can come up for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems. 

Most solutions are written in Haskell, since it is the language I prefer to practice puzzles. 

The solutions themselves are often aiming to concision to write, rather than algorithmic efficiency. 

Within Haskell, I tend to prefer simple Haskell, and point-free.

Each file is self-contained, so this is not a cabal project or file.
